Abstract: Robots are increasingly involved in our daily lives. Fundamental to robots are the
communication link (or stream) and the applications that connect the robots to their clients or
users. Such communication link and applications are usually supported through client/server
network connection. This networking system is amenable of being attacked and vulnerable to the
security threats. Ensuring security and privacy for robotic platforms is thus critical, as failures and
attacks could have devastating consequences. In this paper, we examine several cyber-physical
security threats that are unique to the robotic platforms; specifically the communication link and the
applications. Threats target integrity, availability and confidential security requirements of the robotic
platforms, which use MobileEyes/arnlServer client/server applications. A robot attack tool (RAT) was
developed to perform specific security attacks. An impact-oriented approach was adopted to analyze
the assessment results of the attacks. Tests and experiments of attacks were conducted in simulation
environment and physically on the robot. The simulation environment was based on MobileSim;
a software tool for simulating, debugging and experimenting on MobileRobots/ActivMedia platforms
and their environments. The robot platform PeopleBotTM was used for physical experiments.
The analysis and testing results show that certain attacks were successful at breaching the robot
security. Integrity attacks modified commands and manipulated the robot behavior. Availability
attacks were able to cause Denial-of-Service (DoS) and the robot was not responsive to MobileEyes
commands. Integrity and availability attacks caused sensitive information on the robot to be hijacked.
To mitigate security threats, we provide possible mitigation techniques and suggestions to raise
awareness of threats on the robotic platforms, especially when the robots are involved in critical
missions or applications.
